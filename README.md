# Chapter 1. Day 1.

### Quests:
1) Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
2) Explain what a Smart Contract is. 
3) Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

### Answers:

1) Blockchain is a shared database. 
 It is open, decentralized and public. 
 Everyone can interact with it.  
 Nobody owns it ( no single person or group has control - rather, all users collectively retain control). 
 Anyone can view the data on it. 
 Blockchain stores data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography. 

2) Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. 

Once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain it will then execute the actions that were written inside of the contract.

3) A transaction is a paid function call. Script is free. 
   A transaction changes the data on the Blockchain. Script only view data on the Blockchain, and do not change it.
